### what is statistical inference?
> What percentage of voers approve of the way the U.S. President is handling his job?

This is difficult to determine `EXACTLY` as there are more than 250 million people of voting age in the U.S. 

However, it is not difficult to `estimate` this percentage.

Pick a sample voters at random.
Then, use the approval percentage among those voters as an estimate for the approval percentage of all voters.

### Technical Terms
<mark>Population</mark>: the entire group of subjects about which we want information.
- all U.S. voters 

<mark>Parameter</mark>: the quantity about the population we are interested in. 
- approval percentage among all U.S. voters

<mark>Sample</mark>: the part of the population from which we collect information. 
- the $N$ voters selected random

<mark>Statistic (estimate)</mark>: the quantity we are interested in as measured in the sample.
- approval percentage among the smapled voters

**Key Point**
even  a relatively small sample (100 or 1000) will produce an estimate that is close to the parameter of very larger population of 250 million subjects.
