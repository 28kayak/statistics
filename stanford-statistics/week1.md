# Percentile, the Five Number Summery, and Standard Deviation
## Five-number Summary
Recall that the boxplot gives a five number summary of data:
- the smallest number (lower wisker)
- 1st quartile
- median
- 34d quartile 
- the largest number

The interquartile range = 3rd quartile - 1st quartile
It measures how spread out the data are. 

## The standard deviation
A more commonly used measure of spread is the `standard deviation`. 

$\bar{x}$ stands for the average of the numbers  $ x_1, x_2, ... x_n$

The standard deviation of these numbers is:

$s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}$

OR

$s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}$

The two numbers $\bar{x}$ and $s$ are often used to summarize data.
Both are sensitive to a few large or small data.
If that is concern (i.e. the histgram is skewed), then it is better to use the `median` and the `interquartile range`.
